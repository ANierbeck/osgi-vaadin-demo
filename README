== Description ==         
This demo shows how to create dynamic and modular web applications with server-side OSGi and Vaadin
The original Version can be found here: http://www.toedter.com/blog/?p=412

I modified it to be usable with Apache Karaf and Blueprint.
To make it more easy it now is also build with maven. 


== Setup ==
Run mvn clean install in the base directory
grab the kar file from the de.nierbeck.ct.osgi.vaadin.kar/target directory
put the kar file in your Apache Karaf deploy folder

call http://localhost:8181/myvaadin 

and be happy :)
